    "text": "I recently published a paper written with Madeleine Monkman on Community Choice Aggregation and solar adoption in Illinois. You can find it online at Energy Findings.\nBartling, Hugh, and Madeleine Monkman. 2024. “Community Choice Electricity Aggregation and Solar Adoption: Evidence From Illinois.” Findings, October. https:/​/​doi.org/​10.32866/​001c.123825.\nAbstract:\nWe explore whether municipalities voting on the community choice aggregation (CCA) model of electricity procurement relates to the adoption of small-scale distributed solar in the US state of Illinois. Municipalities that held a referendum for CCA were more likely to have small-scale solar installations compared to those that did not. Among municipalities with solar installations, those that held CCA referendums have lower per capita solar power generation than those without CCA referendums. The impacts of CCA referendums on small-scale solar adoption are mixed and should be combined with other strategies to promote broader solar adoption in the U.S. energy market."
