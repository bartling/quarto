I am the Director of the School of Public Service at DePaul University, Chicago USA and teach regularly in our graduate programs of Sustainable Urban Development and Public Policy.

My research focuses on local government responses to the climate crisis as it pertains to climate planning, land use reform, low carbon transport, and the promotion of renewable energy.
