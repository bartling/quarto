I am the Director of the Sustainable Urban Development graduate program and an Associate Professor in the School of Public Service at DePaul University, Chicago USA.

My research focuses on local government responses to the climate crisis as it pertains to climate planning, land use reform, low carbon transport, and the promotion of renewable energy.
